1. Download the file **PSCS5OptionalPlugins\_Win\_en\_US.zip** from [this link](http://download.adobe.com/pub/adobe/photoshop/win/cs5/PSCS5OptionalPlugins_Win_en_US.zip) [^2^]. This file contains the extract filter along with other optional plug-ins for Photoshop CS5.
2. Unzip the file and navigate to the folder **PSCS5OptionalPlugins\_Win\_en\_US>Optional Plug-Ins>Win64**. You will find a file named **ExtractPlus.8BF**, which is the extract filter plug-in.
3. Copy the file **ExtractPlus.8BF** and paste it in the folder **C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS5 (64 Bit)\Plug-ins**. This is where Photoshop CS5 looks for plug-ins.
4. Restart Photoshop CS5 if it was already running. You should now see the extract filter under the menu **Filter>Extract**.

The extract filter allows you to draw an outline around the object you want to extract, and then refine the edges using a brush tool. You can also use the eraser tool to remove unwanted parts of the object. Once you are satisfied with the result, you can click OK to apply the extraction.
 
The extract filter is not perfect, and it may not work well on images with very complex backgrounds or low contrast. You may need to use other tools and techniques in Photoshop to improve your extraction, such as refine edge, content-aware fill, or layer masks.
 
If you have a newer version of Photoshop, such as Photoshop CC, you may not need the extract filter at all. Photoshop CC has improved selection tools, such as select subject, quick selection tool, and content-aware move, that can help you separate foreground objects from backgrounds more easily and accurately [^2^].

## How to Use the Extract Filter in Photoshop CS5
 
Once you have installed the extract filter, you can use it to extract foreground objects from complex backgrounds in Photoshop CS5. Here are the basic steps to use the extract filter:

1. Open the image you want to extract in Photoshop CS5.
2. Duplicate the layer by pressing Ctrl+J (Windows) or Command+J (Mac).
3. From the Filter menu, choose Extract. This will open the Extract dialog box.
4. Using the Highlighter tool and a small brush size, draw an outline around the object you want to extract. You don't have to be very precise, but make sure you cover all the edges of the object. You can adjust the brush size using the [ and ] keys.
5. If there are any holes or gaps inside the object, fill them with the Highlighter tool as well.
6. Click on Preview to see how your extraction looks. You can use the Zoom tool to inspect the details.
7. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can use the Cleanup tool to erase any unwanted parts of the object, or use the Edge Touchup tool to refine the edges of the object. You can also adjust the Smoothness and Contrast sliders to improve the quality of your extraction.
8. When you are happy with your extraction, click OK to apply it. You will see your object on a transparent background.

You can now save your extracted object as a PNG file, or use it in another image by copying and pasting it.
  
## Tips and Tricks for Using the Extract Filter in Photoshop CS5
 
The extract filter is a powerful tool, but it has some limitations and challenges. Here are some tips and tricks to help you use it more effectively:

- The extract filter works best on images with high contrast between the foreground and background. If your image has a low contrast or a busy background, you may need to use other methods to make a selection, such as color range, magic wand, or quick mask.
- The extract filter may not handle fine details very well, such as hair or fur. To preserve these details, you can use a larger brush size when drawing the outline, and then use a smaller brush size when refining the edges. You can also use a soft-edged brush for a smoother transition.
- The extract filter may create jagged or pixelated edges on your object. To smooth them out, you can apply a slight Gaussian blur or a feather effect to your object after extracting it.
- The extract filter may leave some color fringes or halos around your object. To remove them, you can use the Defringe command under Layer>Matting, or use a layer mask and a soft brush to erase them.

The extract filter is not perfect, but it can be a useful tool for extracting foreground objects from complex backgrounds in Photoshop CS5. With some practice and patience, you can achieve impressive results with it.
